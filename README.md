# Migraine-Mode-Windows-Theme-
This theme is based off of light therapy in order to help with digital eye strain and migraines. The colors I have chosen were loosely based on color therapy, deep green light(the polar oppsite of the harmful blue light.) nice golden text that is very readable and pretty on the eyes. This took a few hours of work dialing in the colors to a factor that I was pleased with. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not a licensed doctor nor do I claim that this windows theme has good scientific backing or blue light testing. This is not intended to treat, cure or manage any condition. I just find that this mod relaxes my eyes as a patient with migraine disorders and eye strain.

APPLYING THEMES: In order to apply custom themes you'll need to extract them and copy both the .theme files and the theme folder which has the name of the theme to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes.

CREATING YOUR OWN THEME: You are allowed to freely create themes based on this theme but please be respectful and give credit to my repo. I encourage the creation of more scientific migraine reduction themes created with actual medical knowledge, so please don't hestiate to use this theme as a base to help people who suffer with these conditions. I myself have had really bad eyestrain for years and years, and these new dark contress themes have helped me greatly. Your free to even use it as a base for a browser theme or whatever, I don't really care. I did this project to help people, not to profit or anything so go nuts.
